# Strategy for Controlling AI Coding

## Introduction
This document outlines a strategy to ensure the AI adheres to established rules, avoids regressions, and delivers high-quality, maintainable code. By implementing robust safeguards, feedback loops, and proactive validation, we can effectively manage AI behavior.

## Key Principles
1. Guardrails First: Establish clear global and project-specific rules to constrain AI output.
2. Proactive Validation: Implement mechanisms to anticipate and prevent errors before they occur.
3. Feedback Loops: Use iterative, two-pass workflows to ensure quality.
4. Incremental Development: Encourage small, manageable changes over sweeping modifications.
5. User-Driven Focus: Always prioritize user instructions and seek clarifications when needed.

## Workflow
1. Prompt Design:
- Include all relevant rules, context, and tests in the initial prompt.
- Clearly define the scope of changes and the constraints.

2. Two-Pass Development:
- Pass 1 (Planning): AI generates a detailed plan for changes, outlining the scope, risks, and approach
- Pass 2 (Execution): AI executes the approved plan and generates the code.

3. Validation Steps:
- Pre-change: AI identifies potential conflicts and risks.
- Post-change: AI verifies changes against tests and validates adherence to specifications.

4. Change Review:
- Require the AI to output a unified diff and a summary of changes.
- Self-review for regressions or deviations from the rules.

5. Continuous Feedback:
- Use human feedback to reinforce correct behavior and discourage regressions.

## Tools
1. Automated Testing:
- Leverage unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to verify code changes automatically.
- Use `pytest` for test execution and ensure all tests pass before accepting changes.

2. Linting and Formatting:
- Use tools like `pylint` and `black` to ensure adherence to coding standards.
- Run static analysis tools (e.g., `mypy`) for type checking.

3. Version Control:
- Require AI to output unified diffs for every proposed change.
- Use Git for tracking changes and reverting regressions if needed.

4. Change Tracking:
- Maintain a living changelog that documents all significant changes, reasons, and impacts.

5. Error Logging:
- Use logging tools (e.g., `loguru`) to track issues during development and runtime.

## Techniques for Controlling AI Behavior

### 1. Self-Review and Reasoning
- Require the AI to simulate a senior developer reviewing its own code. Ask it to answer:
- What was changed and why?
- How does this change preserve or improve existing functionality?
- Are there any risks or potential regressions?

### 2. Pre-Change Planning
- Ask the AI to propose a detailed plan for the intended changes before writing any code.
- Example Prompt:
  ```plaintext
  Describe how you will implement the requested functionality without affecting existing features. Highlight potential risks and how you will address them.

3. Protected Regions
- Mark critical code sections as “protected” with explicit instructions not to modify them unless explicitly approved.
- Example:

# BEGIN PROTECTED: Authentication Logic
def authenticate_user(credentials):
    ...
# END PROTECTED



4. Validation Contracts
- Include test cases and rules in the AI prompt, making them part of a “contract.”
- Example:

Your changes must pass the following tests:
1. `test_authentication_flow()`: Ensures login functionality works.
2. `test_api_key_validation()`: Verifies API key handling.
If any test fails, revert changes and reevaluate your approach.



5. Just-In-Time Clarifications
- Encourage the AI to ask for clarifications when it encounters ambiguity in the instructions or rules.
- Example Prompt:

If any part of the requirements is unclear, list specific questions before proceeding.



6. Risk Analysis
- Require the AI to assess potential risks associated with its proposed changes.
- Example:

Identify and explain potential risks of the proposed changes. Suggest steps to mitigate these risks.



7. Use of Negative Examples
- Provide examples of incorrect implementations alongside the correct approach to reinforce desirable behavior.
- Example:

BAD:
    def handle_error(error):
        pass  # No logging or feedback

GOOD:
    def handle_error(error):
        logger.error(f"Error occurred: {error}")
        # Recovery logic here



8. Iterative Improvements
- Allow the AI to refine its code iteratively, based on feedback or test results, to achieve the desired outcome without introducing regressions.

Monitoring and Auditing AI Outputs

1. Continuous Testing
- Automatically run test suites after each AI-generated code submission to detect regressions early.
- Example Workflow:
- AI submits a code change.
- CI/CD pipeline runs all tests.
- Notify if any test fails or behavior changes unexpectedly.

2. Peer Review
- Supplement AI outputs with human reviews to catch subtle issues that tests or rules may not detect.
- Example:
- Use the AI’s unified diff and rationale as a starting point for manual code review.

3. Independent AI Audits
- Use a secondary AI to review the primary AI’s code for adherence to rules, guidelines, and specifications.
- Example:

Review the following code for compliance with the rules. Identify any deviations and suggest corrections.



Safeguards Against Regression

1. Regression Tests
- Maintain a robust suite of regression tests to ensure all previously working functionality remains intact.
- Require AI to validate its changes against these tests explicitly.

2. Incremental Development
- Limit AI to small, manageable changes to reduce the likelihood of regressions.
- Example:

Modify only the `fetch_data()` function in this iteration. Do not affect other parts of the codebase.



3. Reversion Policy
- Always maintain a backup of the original code. If regressions are detected, revert to the previous stable version.

4. Changelogs
- Keep a detailed changelog for every modification, including rationale, impacted areas, and validation results.

Handling Edge Cases and Ambiguities

1. Asking for Clarifications
- Encourage the AI to explicitly ask for clarification rather than making assumptions about ambiguous instructions.

2. Simulated User Interaction
- Provide simulated input-output examples for the AI to test its logic against edge cases.

3. Prioritize Non-Regression
- Reinforce that maintaining existing functionality is a higher priority than introducing new features.

Summary

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively control AI behavior, minimize regressions, and ensure high-quality, maintainable code. This layered approach combines automated safeguards, proactive validation, and iterative feedback loops to create a robust development workflow.
